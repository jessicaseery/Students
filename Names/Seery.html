<font size="3" color="Green">The Sims</font>

<font size="3" face="verdana" color="Green">I chose the sims because it is a very popular game that I am personally addicted to. The game because it has many fine details and a ton of options to choose from therefore there is a lot of coding behind the sims and I find that really cool..When you think about it.. somebody had to write a code for every option you have the ability to do!</font>
